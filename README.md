This repo contains the CAD files for a marker dropper used on SubjuGator 8 and 9 by the University of Florida's Machine Intelligence Lab (MIL)

The mechanism is used to accomplish the dropper task in the roboSub competition, where two small balls must be dropper into a small container.

The goals for this mechanism were for it to be as simple as possible and easily modifiable so it can be used in variation of the challenge in future years.
